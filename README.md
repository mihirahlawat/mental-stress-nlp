ABSTRACT

Recent research highlights the potential of inferring an individual’s
mental well-being from their text, particularly on social media plat-
forms. While existing work often focuses on binary classification
for mental health conditions, our novel project aims to incorporate
teenage language nuances—such as puns and dark humor—into the
dataset. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP)
techniques, we seek to develop a nuanced approach for detecting
mental health distress in textual data. This research has significant
implications for improving suicide prevention efforts.
